🧠 What I Learned<br>
-Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

-State Management: Handling an array of objects as the "source of truth" for the UI.

-Asynchronous JS: Managing API calls and handling promises for currency conversion.

-Client-side Storage: Working with JSON parsing and stringification in localStorage.

-Mathematical Logic: Using Array.reduce() and Array.filter() to perform clean, efficient data operations.<br>
